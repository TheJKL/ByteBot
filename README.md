# ByteBot
A Discord bot for storing and sending sound bytes to a channel.

## Planned Features:
- Play sound bytes in server voice channels
- Add sounds by uploading a file while @ing the bot
	- sounds added are indexed and can be given a name for ease of use 
- Sounds are unique to user and server
	- any sound uploaded is saved under the server and any user in the server can use it
	- sounds uploaded by users are saved under the user and can be used by them in any server with the bot (extra argument needed to use personal sounds)
- list stored current sounds in server (or personal) and show indexes
- play random sounds
- automatic stripping of audio from video files (ease of use)

## Possible Features:
- Web interface for uploads/downloads (and maybe even basic sound editing)
- Replay buffer, record last 15 seconds in a channel (allow it to be edited by a user)
